    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sendr</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 06/05/2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to Sendr! This Privacy Policy explains how Sendr ("we,"
      "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in
      relation to our mobile application Sendr (the "Service"), and your
      choices about the collection and use of your information.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access
      the Service ("Users").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Username:</strong> We collect the username you choose or are
            assigned when you use the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content:</strong> We collect the photos you capture, upload,
            or receive through the Service, including any text overlays you add
            ("User Content").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communications:</strong> We may collect information when you
            communicate with us (e.g., for support).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Information collected automatically:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Log file information:</strong> We may log information such
            as your IP address, device type, operating system, app crashes,
            unique device identifiers, and usage patterns when you use the
            Service. This information is collected via our infrastructure
            providers (like AWS) and potentially through Firebase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We may access, collect,
            monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more
            "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or
            similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile
            device, which uniquely identify your mobile device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> We use Google AdMob to
            serve advertisements. AdMob may collect and use advertising
            identifiers (like IDFA for iOS and Advertising ID for Android) and
            other data as described in Google's Privacy Policy to provide
            personalized advertising.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you
            use the Service, such as the features you use, the frequency and
            duration of your activities.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Information from third-party services:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Firebase:</strong> We use Firebase (a Google service) for
            functionalities like push notifications and potentially
            authentication or analytics in the future. Firebase may collect
            certain data as described in Google's Privacy & Terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AWS (Amazon Web Services):</strong> Our backend
            infrastructure, including image storage (S3) and APIs (API Gateway,
            Lambda), is hosted on AWS. AWS processes data on our behalf as
            described in the AWS Privacy Notice.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.</li>
      <li>Process and deliver User Content between users.</li>
      <li>Improve, personalize, and expand the Service.</li>
      <li>Understand and analyze how you use the Service.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you, including for customer service.</li>
      <li>
        Send you push notifications (if enabled) related to Service activity
        (e.g., new messages, replies). You can control this in your device
        settings and app settings.
      </li>
      <li>Show advertisements through Google AdMob.</li>
      <li>Find and prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
      <li>
        Ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions and applicable laws.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from public
        authorities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We may share the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>With Other Users:</strong> Your username and the User Content
        you send are shared with the recipient(s) you designate. Replies are
        shared between the original sender and the replier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with
        third-party vendors and service providers that perform services on our
        behalf, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Cloud hosting and storage (AWS).</li>
          <li>Push notification delivery (Firebase Cloud Messaging).</li>
          <li>Advertising networks (Google AdMob).</li>
          <li>Potentially analytics providers in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        These providers will only have access to the information necessary to
        perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required to
        protect and secure your information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if
        required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
        necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our
        rights or property, prevent fraud, act in urgent circumstances to
        protect the personal safety of users of the Service, or protect against
        legal liability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger,
        acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy,
        receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to
        another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of
        such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Storage Location:</strong> User Content (images) and associated
        data are stored using Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, likely
        in the <code>eu-west-2</code> (London) region based on backend
        configurations, but potentially involving other regions for processing
        or redundancy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong> We implement reasonable security measures
        designed to protect your information from unauthorized access,
        disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no
        security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee
        the security of your information. Transmission of information via the
        internet is not completely secure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User Content (Images):</strong> We retain images you send and
        receive for a limited duration necessary to provide the Service features
        (e.g., until viewed/replied or expired based on Service rules). Specific
        retention periods depend on the implementation of features like
        view-once or expiration timers. User Content may be deleted
        automatically after these periods. Deleted content may persist in
        backups for a limited time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Account Information:</strong> We retain your username and
        associated settings as long as your account is active. If you delete
        your account (if such functionality is offered) or it becomes inactive
        for an extended period, we may delete your information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Log Data:</strong> Log data is typically retained for shorter
        periods for analysis and security purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a
      higher age threshold if required by applicable law). We do not knowingly
      collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we
      have collected personal information from a child under 13 without
      verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete that
      information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a
      child under 13, please contact us.
    </p>

      jurisdiction. If you are located outside the UK/EU and choose to provide
      information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including
      personal information, to regions where our service providers (like AWS)
      operate and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed
      by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that
      transfer.
    </p>
