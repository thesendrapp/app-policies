      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Account Information:</strong> We retain your username and
        associated settings as long as your account is active. If you delete

        retention requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Compliance Records:</strong> Information required for law
        enforcement compliance may be retained for extended periods as required
        by applicable laws and regulations.
      </li>

    <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers
      located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental
      jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your
      jurisdiction. If you are located outside the UK/EU and choose to provide
      information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including
      personal information, to regions where our service providers (like AWS)
      operate and process it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      For users in the EU/EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for
      international transfers in accordance with GDPR requirements. Your consent
      to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information
      represents your agreement to that transfer.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Law Enforcement and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      We maintain comprehensive records to support law enforcement
      investigations and comply with legal requirements. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>User identification and verification data</li>
      <li>Communication logs and interaction patterns</li>
      <li>Device fingerprints and IP address histories</li>
      <li>Content sharing and viewing records</li>
      <li>Platform activity and behavioral analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies and may proactively
      report suspicious activities, especially those involving minors or
      potential harm.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

      any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app and
      updating the "Last Updated" date. For significant changes affecting users
      aged 15-17, we may require additional consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
      changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are
